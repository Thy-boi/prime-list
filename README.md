# prime-list

Just a small script that gets you the range of prime numbers. It seems pretty insignificant,
but I'm actually really proud I made it. My CS advisor told me to make it, and I tried
to remember how to do it, because I saw a solution on the internet for it before, but
instead of searching it up, I decided to do it my own way, and I'm happy that I made it work better than
before.
